# UMDv3
The Universal Mega Dumper v2 project aims to be a complete open-sourced solution for cartridge dumping and writing. It includes a very performant MCU which has a direct memory connection to a generalized databus consisting of 24 address bits and 16 data lines. Along with a dozen or so control signals, it should be sufficient to interface with most cartridge types.

## Project
Please refer to the [UMDv3 Firmware Project Repository](https://github.com/db-electronics/UMDv3) for UMDv3 documentation and instructions as this is the project's central repository.

# Dependencies
## Parts Libraries
All components in this PCB depend on [my KiCad libraries](https://github.com/db-electronics/kicadlib) which are available here on github. I don't use any pre-existing libraries - *fight me*.
